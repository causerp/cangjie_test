# Before running the full suite of iOS simulator exe-route test cases, ad-hoc sign the shared runtime dylibs once, up front.
# Since the runtime dylibs are shared by all test cases, signing them concurrently in each test case's run script would race,
# so sign them all together in advance; the run scripts no longer call sign_runtime_dylibs.
#
# usage:
#   bash ios_sign_runtime.sh [arm64|x86_64]
